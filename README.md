# What is this?

This is a small react website I am using to practice japanese.

Currently it gives you a flash card containing a katakana or hiragana character and you must type
the romaji/pronounciation of it.

I plan on eventually adding Kanji characters as I learn them.

# How can I run this locally?
If you want to run this locally simply clone the repo, install the dependencies and run it.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adonca2203/japanese-practice.git && \
cd japanese-practice && \
npm install && \
npm start
```
